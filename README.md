# Hi 👋, I am Piyush Zaware

I am a Master of Public Policy student at the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy, specializing in Data Analytics. I am interested in applied economic research that uses rich micro-level data and careful empirical design to answer policy-relevant questions, especially at the intersection of human capital, institutions, and political economy.

I currently work as a Research Assistant at the Center for the Economics of Human Development, where I study family structure, intergenerational mobility, and the long-run impacts of early childhood interventions using large-scale panel data such as IPUMS-CPS and the NLSY79/CNLSY. My work combines applied econometrics with psychometric methods, including structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis, to model latent cognitive and non-cognitive skill formation across randomized control trials in the United States, Jamaica, China, and Ireland.

Alongside this work, I have contributed to applied finance and public policy research at the Harris School, building reproducible computational tools for forward-rate curve estimation and perceived cost-of-capital analysis using large bond datasets. I have also worked on political economy and development policy projects in the Indian context, including data-driven analysis of national budgets, agricultural finance, and voter behavior, with an emphasis on translating empirical findings into actionable policy insights.

My quantitative training spans econometrics, causal inference, machine learning, and numerical modeling. Before graduate school, I was trained as a mechanical engineer and worked on applied machine learning problems, publishing peer-reviewed research on fault detection using supervised learning and time-series data. That engineering background still shapes how I approach economic research: I care deeply about data construction, model validation, and robustness before interpretation.

Across projects, my goal is simple but demanding: to produce research that is empirically rigorous, transparent, and grounded in real institutional constraints. I am especially drawn to research environments that value methodological discipline, interdisciplinary collaboration, and close engagement with policymakers. Looking ahead, I plan to pursue a research-oriented career in applied economics and public policy.
