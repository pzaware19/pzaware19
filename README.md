I am a Master of Public Policy student at the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy, specializing in Data Analytics. I am interested in research that focuses on topics utilising micro level data with advanced econmetrics or machine learning methods. I am interested in topics realted to applied economics
I currently work as a Research Assistant at the Center for the Economics of Human Development, where my work uses large-scale panel data (IPUMS-CPS, NLSY79/CNLSY) and structural modeling techniques to study family structure, intergenerational mobility, and the long-run impacts of early childhood interventions. My research combines applied econometrics with psychometric methods, including structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis, to identify latent cognitive and non-cognitive skill formation processes across randomized control trials in the United States, Jamaica, China, and Ireland.
Alongside this work, I have contributed to applied finance and public policy research at the Harris School of Public Policy, developing reproducible computational tools for forward-rate curve estimation and cost-of-capital analysis using large bond datasets. I have also worked on political economy and development policy projects, including data-driven analysis of India’s national budgets, agricultural finance, and voter behavior, translating empirical findings into policy-relevant insights for policymakers.
My quantitative training spans econometrics, causal inference, machine learning, and numerical modeling. Prior to graduate study, I conducted research in mechanical engineering and applied machine learning, publishing peer-reviewed work on fault detection using supervised learning methods and time-series data. This technical foundation informs my approach to economic research, particularly in settings that require careful data construction, model validation, and robustness analysis.
Across projects, my goal is to produce empirically rigorous, transparent research that engages directly with real-world policy constraints. I am particularly drawn to research environments that combine methodological rigor with close engagement with policymakers and institutions, and I plan to pursue a research-oriented career in applied economics and public policy.
