# Hi 👋, I am Piyush Zaware

<p align="justify">
I am a Master of Public Policy student at the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy, specializing in Data Analytics. I am interested in applied economic research that uses rich micro-level data and careful empirical design to answer policy-relevant questions, especially at the intersection of human capital, institutions, and political economy.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I currently work as a Research Assistant at the Center for the Economics of Human Development, where I study family structure, intergenerational mobility, and the long-run impacts of early childhood interventions using large-scale panel data such as IPUMS-CPS and the NLSY79/CNLSY. My work combines applied econometrics with psychometric methods, including structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis, to model latent cognitive and non-cognitive skill formation across randomized control trials in the United States, Jamaica, China, and Ireland.

Alongside this work, I have contributed to applied finance and public policy research at the Harris School, building reproducible computational tools for <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17ADHPGc95_g8DQkionbmAZPg1dn7Dylo/view">forward-rate curve estimation</a> and perceived cost-of-capital analysis using large bond datasets. I have also worked on political economy and development policy projects in the Indian context, including data-driven analysis of national budgets, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17ADHPGc95_g8DQkionbmAZPg1dn7Dylo/view">agricultural finance</a>, and voter behavior, with an emphasis on translating empirical findings into actionable policy insights.
</p>

<p align="justify">
My quantitative training spans econometrics, causal inference, machine learning, and numerical modeling. Before graduate school, I was trained as a mechanical engineer and worked on applied machine learning problems, publishing peer-reviewed research on <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S8JqcraSrLkiDR_8nvPf8nUJF6AggI9a/view">fault detection using supervised learning and time-series data</a>. That engineering background still shapes how I approach economic research: I care deeply about data construction, model validation, and robustness before interpretation.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Across projects, my goal is simple but demanding: to produce research that is empirically rigorous, transparent, and grounded in real institutional constraints. I am especially drawn to research environments that value methodological discipline, interdisciplinary collaboration, and close engagement with policymakers. Looking ahead, I plan to pursue a research-oriented career in applied economics and public policy.
